This is a project from the Math of Games course that I took at The Evergreen
State College in the summer of 2005. The goal was to analyze the game of
2D Nim.

Abstract
--------
This paper is an investigation of 2-Dimensional Nim as it was proposed in
Unsolved Problems in Combinatorial Games problem 46. A position in the game
is a rectangular matrix of non-negative integers. At each move a player selects
a row or column and subtracts any positive integer from any of the numbers in that
row or column.

Introduction
------------
I started my investigation of 2-Dimensional Nim by writing a program in C++ to
find the values of different positions. Using the results of the program I came
up with generalizations and attempted to prove them. What follows is my analysis
of 2-Dimensional Nim and a description of my C++ program.
